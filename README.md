# Sorting Balls

## Overview
A project that compares and benchmarks three sorting methods for organizing colored balls into silos:
1. **Conventional Sorting** - Alphabetically sorts balls in each silo.
2. **Entropy-Based Sorting** - Minimizes disorder (entropy) by redistributing balls by color.
3. **Pairwise Sorting** - Balances silos iteratively by swapping adjacent balls.

## Features
- Generates silos filled with random colored balls.
- Measures and compares the performance of sorting algorithms.
- Saves a visual graph of the results.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
