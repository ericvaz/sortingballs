# Silo Sorting Comparison

This project compares three sorting algorithms for organizing colored balls in silos:
1. **Conventional Sorting**: Sorts balls alphabetically within each silo.
2. **Entropy-Based Sorting**: Minimizes entropy by redistributing balls by color.
3. **Pairwise Sorting**: Balances color distributions between adjacent silos through iterative swaps.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code for generation, sorting methods, performance measurement, and visualization.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation and results.
- `data/`: Sample input data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/silo-sorting-comparison.git
